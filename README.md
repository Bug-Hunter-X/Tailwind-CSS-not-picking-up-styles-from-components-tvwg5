# Tailwind CSS Not Picking Up Styles

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS fails to recognize and apply styles from your components. The problem often stems from an incorrect or incomplete `content` configuration within your Tailwind CSS configuration file (usually `tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.cjs`).

## Problem

Tailwind CSS isn't applying styles to your components despite having the correct classes and configuration. This can cause frustrating inconsistencies in your project's styling.

## Solution

The primary solution involves correctly specifying the `content` array in your `tailwind.config.js` to include all the files where Tailwind directives might be used.
